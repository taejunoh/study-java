# Taejun's log of studying JAVA and Spring Boot
I want to document the process I am studying. I hope that by evaluating and sharing the material I have studied, it will be helpful to everyone studying JAVA.

I am working as a soft engineer in the United States and English is my second language. Therefore, I will study both English and Korean materials.
